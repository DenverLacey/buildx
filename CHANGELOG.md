# 0.4.0 - TBD

* Add `project` command that prints the contents of the `conf.ini` file for the current project.
* Add `project SETTING=VALUE` command that changes settings of the current project.
* Add `project upgrade` command so projects using older verisons of `buildx` can upgrade to the latest version.
